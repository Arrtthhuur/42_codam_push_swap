# 42_codam_push_swap
The Push_swap project is a very simple and highly effective algorithm project: data will need to be sorted. You have at your disposal a set of int values, 2 stacks and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks.

## Usage
The push_swap program will be executed as follows:

```bash
./push_swap <list_of_integers>
```

It takes as an argument the stack a formatted as a list of integers. The first argument should be at the top of the stack (be careful about the order).

### Goal
The goal is to sort the stack with the lowest possible number of operations.

### Constraints
Functions allowed: read, write, malloc, free, exit.

### Return value
- The program must display the smallest list of instructions possible to sort the stack a, the smallest number being at the top. 
- Instructions must be separated by a ’\n’ and nothing else.
- If no parameters are specified, the program must not display anything and give the prompt back.
- In case of error, it must display "Error" followed by a ’\n’ on the standard error. Errors include for example: some arguments aren’t integers, some arguments are bigger than an integer and/or there are duplicates.

# checker_bonus
Thanks to the checker program, you will be able to check whether the list of instructions generated by the push_swap program actually sorts the stack properly.

## Usage
The checker program will be executed as follows:

```bash
./checker <list_of_integers>
```
